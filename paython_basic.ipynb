        "  **2.Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:**\n",
        "     Python offers a vast collection of libraries and frameworks for various tasks, such as data science (NumPy, Pandas etc), web development (Django, Flask), and machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch). These pre-built modules save developers time and effort.\n",
